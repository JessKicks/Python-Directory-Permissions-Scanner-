Welcome to Dirscan.py.

to run it: "python3 Dirscan.py".

It's a simple file that takes user input to select a chosen directory.
Dirscan.py will display which files in that directory have permissions o+x. 
It will ask the user if they want to remove the execute permission from Others.
Then will output a success, or error messsage.

Thanks!
