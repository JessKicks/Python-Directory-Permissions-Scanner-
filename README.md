# Python-Directory-Permissions-Scanner-
This file scans a directory, displays all files with perms o+x, and gives the option to remove the execute permisisons. 

This was built as a test of the AI Code assistant located in Visual Studio Code 1.107.
From concept to production took approximately 10 minutes. 
This code went through 4 versions, each version with a new user friendly code addition. 

Version 1 was a rudimentary function which accepted a user input directory and simply displayed the files with incoorect permissinos with verbose output. 
Version 2 was upgraded to include some user prompts. 
Version 3 added the option to the file permissions recursively, and displayed verbose output to the user.
Version 4 included cleaner output. 

Basic error handling has been built in since version 1.
